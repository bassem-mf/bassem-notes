# Welcome to Bassem's Notes!

I made this website to save my notes in a structured format. The notes mostly focus on what is relevant to my work instead of completely
covering the topics. But I think they can still be useful to other people. So I made them public.

I try to keep these notes up-to-date as things change. If you find any incorrect or outdated information, feel free to open an issue on GitHub or submit a pull request.
